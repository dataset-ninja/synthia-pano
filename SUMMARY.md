**SYNTHIA-PANO Panoramic Image Dataset** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 3236 images with 43308 labeled objects belonging to 14 different classes including *void*, *sky*, *building*, and other: *road*, *vegetation*, *pole*, *car*, *traffic sign*, *landmarking*, *sidewalk*, *pedestrian*, *traffic light*, *fence*, and *bicycle*.

Images in the SYNTHIA-PANO dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, each image contains information about its ***sequence***: ***seqs02_fall***, ***seqs02_summer***,***seqs04_fall***, ***seqs04_summer***, ***seqs05_summer***. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2019 by the College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, China.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
